Planning Rule

Use the MCP server during planning
Apply components wherever components are applicable
Use whole blocks where possible (e.g., login page, calendar) unless specified otherwise

Implementation Rule
When implementing:

First call the demo tool to see how it is used
Then implement it so that it is implemented correctly
Also install the components. Don't write the files yourself.
